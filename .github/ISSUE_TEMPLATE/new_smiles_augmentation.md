## New SMILES Augmentation Technique Description

A clear and concise description of the new SMILES augmentation technique you would like to propose (e.g., tautomer generation, stereoisomerization, etc.).

## Purpose

Explain the purpose of this augmentation technique. Consider addressing:

- How it can enhance the robustness of the model.
- Specific tasks or scenarios where this technique would be beneficial.
- Tasks where this technique might not be suitable.
- Any existing limitations in the current augmentation methods that this would address.

## Implementation Ideas

If you have specific ideas on how to implement this technique, please provide them here. This could include:

- The algorithms or methods that could be used for augmentation.
- Potential libraries or tools that could assist in the implementation.
- Relevant research or literature that supports the proposed approach.
