## New Layered DAG Description

A clear and concise description of the new layered DAG you would like to propose, including:

- Name of the DAG
- Overview of the structure and layers (e.g., number of layers, types of nodes)

## Purpose

Explain the purpose of this new DAG. Consider addressing:

- How it will enhance the current modeling framework.
- Specific tasks or objectives that this DAG will support.
- Any particular relationships or hierarchies that the DAG will represent.

## DAG Structure

Please provide details about the structure of the proposed DAG, including:

- Node types and their relationships (e.g., parent-child relationships).
- Any specific rules or constraints governing the connections.
- Example scenarios illustrating how this DAG would be utilized.

## Rationale

Explain the rationale for adding this DAG. Consider addressing:

- How it complements existing DAGs in the project.
- Potential advantages it offers over current structures.
- Gaps in current DAGs that this new DAG would fill.

## Example

If applicable, provide a visual representation or textual description of the DAG structure, including:

- Sample nodes and edges.
- Any relevant metadata associated with nodes or edges.

## Additional Context

Add any other context or information that might be helpful in considering this request, such as:

- How you envision integrating this DAG into the existing project structure.
- Any challenges you foresee in using this DAG or potential areas for improvement.
